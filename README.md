# Mazda Carlot
## Single Page Applications Milestone Challenge

For this Nashville Software School challenge, we were asked to mock-up a car dealership website.

The car data is loaded into a private array and then printed to the DOM. When the user clicks a card, that card is visually selected and the user may edit the car's description using the input field in the nav bar. When the user hits enter, the description and any edits are saved to the card, and the card is deselected. This exercise was designed as a test of my bootstrap and vanilla javascript DOM manipulation skills.
